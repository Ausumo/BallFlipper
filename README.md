Ball Flipper 🎮
Ball Flipper was my very first mobile game and marked the beginning of my journey into mobile game development.

Origin ✨
The idea came from my desire to create a simple yet challenging game that reflected my first steps as a developer.
Ball Flipper was a learning project where I explored the fundamentals of mobile development and experienced the
full process, from concept to release.

Gameplay 🕹️
A ball continuously moves counterclockwise around a circle.

By tapping the screen, the ball’s direction can be changed.

The longer you hold the tap, the longer the ball stays in the opposite direction.

From the left side of the screen, different objects fly past the circle:

Some can be collected as points.

Others must be avoided to keep playing.

This simple mechanic combined quick reactions with increasing difficulty, making the game both accessible and engaging.

Release 📱
Ball Flipper was published on the Google Play Store, where it could be downloaded and played.
Releasing it publicly was a major milestone for me as a developer.

Status 🛑
For personal reasons, I decided to remove Ball Flipper from the store.
Even though it is no longer available, it remains an important project that shaped my path as a developer.
